# What is this repo?
Bypass the limits of what Github codespaces can do.
# What am I supposed to do?
Fork this repo and make a [codespace](https://github.com/codespaces), and use the codespace.
# What are Github codespaces?
Each codespace has Ubuntu , with two free options on specs, with rather a 2-core CPU VM, with 8 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage, or a 4-core VM, with 16 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage.
# The funny part
If you grab the IP address of a VM with Grabify, or Google who owns Github, it shows Microsoft. I would expect codespaces to run Windows with winget or something if Microsoft owns it, but MS themselves embrace Linux and has a [guide to linux themselves.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/shell/)
